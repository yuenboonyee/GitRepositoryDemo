This project demonstrates how to use SourceTree (a Git client) to:
- Reverse a commit
- Reset a branch to a commit
- Undo a merge


Reverse a commit
================
This creates a new commit which undoes the changes in the previous commit. The commits still appear in the commit history. Only the changes are reversed.
Method:
- Select the commit you want to reverse.
- Right-click and select 'Reverse commit'.


Reset a branch to a commit
==========================
This completely removes commits from the repository. Any commits past the selected point no longer appear in the repository.
Method:
- Select the commit you want to 'roll back' to. Any commits past this point will cease to exist.
- Right-click and select 'Reset [branch name] to this commit'.


Undo a merge
